========

An incomplete framework for a multiplayer role playing game.

Clients would have the option of connecting via:

*  a graphical frontend (raycasting) 
*  a terminal (telnet)
*  a web page (websockets)

Uses MongoDB for data storage and Lua for scripting

### Dependencies:

* c++11 or higher
* libarg3
* libsdl2
* liblua
* libwebsockets
* libmongoclient

Why?
----

I'm not the best graphics programmer, so this was an attempt at using some code I'm familar with and putting it to raycasting as a first step.

I'm open sourcing it because why the hell not?  I don't think it has any monetary value this day and age.
