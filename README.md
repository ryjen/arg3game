========

An incomplete framework for a multiplayer role playing game.

Clients would have the option of connecting via:

*  a graphical frontend (raycasting) 
*  a terminal (telnet)
*  a web page (websockets)

Uses MongoDB for data storage and Lua for scripting

### Setup

run ```git submodule update --init --recursive```

### Dependencies:

* c++11 or higher
* libarg3
* libsdl2
* liblua
* libwebsockets
* libmongoclient

Why?

I'm experiementing with graphics programming, raycasting is my hello world.
